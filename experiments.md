* seed everything
* vary temperature, epochs, batchsize, models resnet18 and resnet50 (try all torchvision models. vary the width as well. do all models react well to SSL?); 
* future. auto ablation. ablation.py sees the arg.parser. takes in another file which user tells "what ablations to run". ablation.py gets result for all experiments in user's input file. + nice report + auto finds trends among things if they are present. + auto nice plots.
